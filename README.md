**Neura Display** is a high-contrast hybrid typeface designed for a futuristic, editorial aesthetic. By stripping traditional serif "feet" (nails and foots) while retaining elegant half-serif terminals and rounded corners, it bridges the gap between scientific precision and luxury fashion. 

It is a sans-serif font at its core, but these unique terminal treatments provide a "serif-ish" vibe that makes it stand out in tech, AI, and high-end branding contexts.

## Features
- **Variable weight axis:** ranging from 100 (Thin) to 900 (Black).
- **Hybrid Geometry:** Sans-serif skeleton with high-contrast, half-serif terminals.
- **Optimized for Display:** High stroke contrast designed specifically for large headlines and editorial layouts.
