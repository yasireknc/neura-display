    Neura Display is a high-contrast hybrid typeface designed for a futuristic, editorial aesthetic. By stripping traditional serif "feet" (nails and foots) while retaining elegant half-serif terminals and rounded corners, it bridges the gap between scientific precision and luxury fashion.

<p>
    It is a sans-serif font at its core, but these unique terminal treatments provide a "serif-ish" vibe that makes it stand out in tech, AI, and high-end branding contexts. The family features a variable weight axis ranging from 100 (Thin) to 900 (Black), specifically optimized for large headlines and display use.
